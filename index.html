    <h1>CVS SELF-CHECKOUT ❤️</h1>

    <h2>Interface Overview</h2>
    <img class="initialDrawing" src="InitialDrawing.png">
    <p>Above, we have the self-checkout system at the CVS on Thayer Street. There are three main components which I have numbered. The first one is the bag holder where customers place their scanned items and can bag their groceries. The second is the touchscreen that guides the customer through the checkout process. I have expanded this component into multiple screens as this is the centerpiece of the interface. Lastly, we have the payment pin pad and screen which are used to pay for the groceries. These three components work in conjunction to form the self-checkout system. </p>

    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <div id="observationsBox">

            <h2>QUESTIONS FOR USERS</h2>
            <p>
                <div id="question">
                    1) Did you find the process intuitive? Did you think there was an obvious flow to the interface? <br>
                </div>
                Users generally felt that the process was intuitive; however, there were hiccups such as required placement of scanned items into bagging area and not receiving promised discount. <br>
                <div id="question">
                    2) Do you always put in a CVS card phone number? <br>
                </div>
                For the most part, users enter their CVS card phone numbers when using self-checkout; they definitely would if a discount is on the line. They mentioned that it is sometimes easy to forget to enter their phone number, as they are never specifically prompted about it but must take the initiative to tap the enter phone number button. <br>
                <div id="question">
                    3) Do you generally get your receipt? If so, in what fashion (print or email)? <br>
                </div>
                Users were split on this question, with some preferring a paper receipt and some preferring no receipt; all users thought this part of the interface was easily accessible. <br>
                <div id="question">
                    4) Do you always use the self-checkout rather than the in-person checkout? If so, is it because the interface is easy to use? <br>
                </div>
                Most people tend to end up going through self-checkout, but if there is a line at self-checkout they would turn to in-person checkout. <br>
                <div id="question">
                    5) Do you generally pay with credit card or do you use Apple Pay when going through self checkout? <br>
                </div>
                Users reported using both Apple Pay and physical credit cards when paying at CVS. They appreciate the flexibility and do not mind that they are unable to pay with cash. <br>

    <h2>Empathy Maps</h2>
    <div id="empathyMapsBox">
        <div class="empathyMapsItem">
            <h3>Impatient Ian</h3>
            <img class="mapPicture" src="ImpatientIan.png">
            <p>Impatient Ian is a stressed, single investment banker in his late twenties. Every minute he spends away from the office is money off his paycheck. Ian faces problems that stem from this impatience such as tapping through screens too quickly and making a mistake or forgetting to input his CVS phone number to apply discounts. He also may have a more limited selection given some items require an ID proving sufficient age, which in turn, requires an employee check; this would mean Ian would have to wait which he would likely find frustrating. Here, Ian represents the user who had to have their ID checked while purchasing cold medicine and was forced to wait for an employee before completing the transaction. Furthermore, Ian represents the user who had issues applying the discount to the items that were supposed to be discounted as well as the user who always skips the inputting of their CVS card phone number.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="empathyMapsItem">
            <h3>Scatterbrained Steven</h3>
            <div class="mapPicture">
                <img class="mapPicture" src="ScatterbrainedSteven.png">
            </div>
            <p>Scatterbrained Steven is a college student with too many things on his plate and a weak organizational skillset; this results in him living in his thoughts and always appearing slightly out of it in the present. Steven potentially runs into problems such as forgetting to input his CVS card phone number as well as forgetting what items he went to CVS for in the first place. Furthermore, he certainly has the potential to get confused by the scanning/payment component of the self-checkout interface. Steven represents the user who did not realize that they had to place scanned items in the bagging area prior to scanning additional items (required an employee to explain this). Steven also represents the user who's discount was not applied; in Steven's case, this would be because he forgot to input his CVS card phone number.</p>
